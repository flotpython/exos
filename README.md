# flotpython companion

this repo contains exercises and TPs that complement the Python MOOC

as a general rule, the nbautoeval-based auto-corrected exercises are bundled in the flotpython/course repo - that was historically for technical reasons, although it is not clear that it's still relevant

in any case, in this repo I try to gather all the other, generally more informal, material for practising Python and/or the Data-Science ecosystem

## contents

the material is organized along these 2 categories, and in each categories we try to make a distinction between

* `exos`: short, simple one-shot assignments
* `tps`: more elaborate assignments, with several steps, that let students achieve something
* `howtos`: more for reading than for practising, that can be recipes to achieve some common tasks

as well as, less interesting probably:

* `samples`: miscell pieces of code that can come in handy
* `reading`: the idea was to gather full-length projects, that students could read; may disappear on the long run, and merged with `samples`

## online

these 2 categories are available online here, with an attempt to organize each content into meaningful sections:

* [pure-Python: start here](https://nbhosting.inria.fr/builds/python-exos/python/latest/README.html)
* [pure-Python: start here](https://nbhosting.inria.fr/builds/python-exos/data-science/latest/README.html)
