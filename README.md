# flotpython companion

this repo contains exercises and TPs that complement the Python MOOC

as a general rule, the nbautoeval-based auto-corrected exercises are bundled in the flotpython/course repo - that was historically for technical reasons, although it is not clear that it's still relevant

in any case, in this repo I try to gather all the other, generally more informal, material for practising Python and/or the Data-Science ecosystem
